# High-Low Card Game

A modern web-based implementation of the classic High-Low card guessing game, featuring probability calculations, card counting assistance, and AI-powered strategy recommendations.

## 🎮 Game Overview

High-Low is a strategy card game where you try to empty a deck by correctly predicting whether the next card will be higher, lower, or the same rank as cards on the playing field.

### How to Play

1. **Setup**: 9 cards are dealt face-up in a 3×3 grid, with the remaining 43 cards in the draw deck
2. **Choose a Stack**: Select one of the 9 stacks to play on
3. **Make a Prediction**: Guess if the next card from the deck will be:
   - **Higher** than the top card of your chosen stack
   - **Lower** than the top card of your chosen stack  
   - **Same** rank as the top card of your chosen stack
4. **Outcome**: 
   - **Correct guess**: The drawn card is added to your stack, and you continue
   - **Wrong guess**: The stack becomes "failed" and can't be used anymore
5. **Win Condition**: Empty the entire deck (all 43 remaining cards)
6. **Lose Condition**: All 9 stacks become failed

### Card Ranking
Cards are ranked from lowest to highest: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace**

## 🚀 Features

### Core Gameplay

## 🎲 Game Modes

### Standard Mode
Classic gameplay with manual probability calculations

### EZ Mode  
Shows probability percentages on action buttons:
- **67%** chance the next card is higher
- **13%** chance the next card is the same rank
- **19%** chance the next card is lower

### EZ-EZ Mode
AI assistant provides optimal move suggestions:
- **Recommended moves** highlighted with visual indicators
- **Confidence ratings** for each suggestion
- **Alternative strategies** with explanations
- **Real-time analysis** using Monte Carlo simulations

## 📊 Probability & Strategy

### Card Counting
The game tracks all visible cards to calculate accurate probabilities:
- **Remaining deck composition** updates after each move
- **Real-time odds calculation** for all possible outcomes
- **Visual charts** showing card distribution

### Optimal Strategy
Based on Monte Carlo analysis:
- **Perfect play win rate**: ~65-70% (varies by initial setup)
- **Unwinnable scenarios**: ~8-12% of random initial deals
- **Key insight**: Focus on preserving stacks with middle-value cards (6-9)
- **Risk management**: Avoid high-variance moves when ahead

### Common Strategies

#### Conservative (Lower Risk)
- Prefer moves with 60%+ probability
- Avoid same-rank guesses unless very confident
- Preserve multiple stacks for flexibility

#### Aggressive (Higher Reward)  
- Take calculated risks with 40-50% probability moves
- Use same-rank guesses strategically
- Focus on clearing specific stacks quickly

#### Optimal (AI-Calculated)
- Dynamic strategy based on current game state
- Balances immediate probability with long-term position
- Considers all possible future outcomes
